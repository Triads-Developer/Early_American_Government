## Early American Governance: The First Decades

Led by [Professor Peter Kastor](https://history.wustl.edu/people/peter-kastor) at Washington University in St. Louis, this project aims to uncover how the federal government operated during the early years of the Constitution. Despite the wealth of resources available about the Founding Fathers and the federal system they established, there are still basic questions that remain unanswered.

This website answers those questions in a unique way, by reconstructing the federal workforce during the crucial decades following ratification of the Constitution. The portal aims to explore not what the Founding Fathers imagined for the country, but rather the government that they actually built.

The project chronicles the public careers of not only the well-known leaders of the early republic, but also the thousands of other people who participated in federal governance but whose names have long been forgotten. It captures the size, shape, and scope of federal agencies and shows where the federal government was located both nationally and internationally.

The archive on this website compiles the records chronicling how people joined, served, and left the federal government. Rather than a story of the elected officials who operated at the state or federal level, this project examines the appointed officials tasked with the daily activities of federal governance.

Users are invited to explore the archive and learn about individual federal officeholders or the broader patterns of officeholding. Join us on this exciting journey to uncover the truth about how Americans governed themselves during the Constitution’s first tumultuous decades.
